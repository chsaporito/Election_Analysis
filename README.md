## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this Election audit project is to add additional summaries of the data.  In addition to aggregating candidate vote counts, percentage of the vote and the election winner, we will now add summaries for county metrics which will include the number of votes or voter turnout in each county, the percentage of votes from each county and determine the county with the highest turnout.
